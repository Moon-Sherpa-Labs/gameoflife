      <h2>About Conway's Game of Life</h2>
      <p>
        Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
        It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game consists of a grid of cells that can be in one of two states: alive or dead.
        Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells adjacent to it horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following rules determine the next state of each cell:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).</li>
        <li>A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).</li>
        <li>A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The game demonstrates how complex patterns and behaviors can emerge from simple rules.
        It's widely used in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, physics, biology, and philosophy.
